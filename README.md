## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd job-portal
```

**2. Backend Setup:**

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a PostgreSQL database with the name you will specify in the .env file (e.g., job_portal_dev)

# Create a .env file in the /server directory
# Copy the contents from .env.example below and fill in your details
touch .env
```

`server/.env.example`

You can find it inside the folder rename it to `.env` and config it properly.

```conf
PORT=5000
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_NAME=your_postgres_db
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

JWT_SECRET=use_any_256_bit_alpha_numeric_string

# For nodemailer use Google Mail with App Password
EMAIL_USER=example@mail.com
EMAIL_PASS=app_password
```

**3. Frontend setup**

```bash
# Navigate to the client directory from the root folder
cd ../client

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

`client/.env`

This is already present. Ensure it looks like this.

```conf
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```
Running the Application
You will need to run two terminals simultaneously.

1. In the first terminal, start the Backend Server:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The backend will be running on http://localhost:5000.

2. In the second terminal, start the Frontend Client:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The frontend application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
